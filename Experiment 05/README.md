# 1. Create a python package called ‘stack_app’ where the following modules are implemented : (at least 2 modules)  and demonstrate their usage.
    a. in_post.py (for Infix to Postfix conversion)
    b. post_eval.py (for Postfix Evaluation)
    c. in_pre.py (for Infix to Prefix conversion)
    d. pre_post.py (to convert prefix to postfix)
# 2. Create a python package called ‘linkedlist_ops’ where the following modules are implemented: (at least 2 modules)  and demonstrate their usage.
    a. del_dup.py (to remove the duplicate elements in the LL)
    b. sort_ll.py (to sort the elements in a LL)
    c. merge_ll.py (to merge the two given LLs after sorting)
    d. add_ll.py (to sum all the elements in the LL)
# 3. Write an implementation of the Priority Queue ADT using List. Also keep the list sorted so that removal is a constant time operation.
